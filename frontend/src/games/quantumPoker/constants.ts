 * hashed into the 32-byte stateHash, never in the message). The backend `/settle` body cap is 32 MB,
 * so a tunnel fits ~7000 hands before overflow (→ 413, silent fallback to a direct close with no
 * Walrus proof); 2500 leaves a wide margin (~12 MB, ~35%). A higher cap means fewer settle gaps and
 * higher self-play TPS, traded against a bigger settle body and a longer cooperative close — being
 * tuned by benchmark (180 → 800 → 1500 → 2500).
