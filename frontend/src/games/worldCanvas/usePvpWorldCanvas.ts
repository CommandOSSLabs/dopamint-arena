/**
 * Online PvP for World Canvas: two real humans matched over the relay co-sign ONE
 * genuine 2-party tunnel and co-draw a shared canvas. Built on the shared, proven
 * {@link createPvpMatchHook} engine (matchmaking → fund → propose/ack co-sign → settle),
 * specialized by the {@link WorldCanvasPvpProtocol} (rolling-digest co-sign + a render-only
 * cell list) and a BATCHED paint move. With Auto on, both seats are bot-driven.
 *
 * Throughput: the channel is turn-based (the seats co-sign alternately), so one cell per
 * turn would crawl and a fast drag would lose most of its cells. Instead each co-signed
 * move carries a RUN of cells: `paint()` buffers your cells and flushes the whole pending
 * run as ONE move on your turn, trimming cells from the buffer as they confirm in the
 * view — so a drag crosses as a stroke, not sparse dots. The batch move is JSON-native
 * (chunk indices are JS safe ints), so the tunnel carries it over the relay with no codec,
 * exactly like chicken-cross.
