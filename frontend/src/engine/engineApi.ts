 * Contracts for the browser tunnel-client Web Worker (design:
 * docs/design/frontend-tunnel-client-worker.md).
 *
 * ALL PvP windows share ONE relay-socket "hub" worker ({@link PvpHubApi}), multiplexed by matchId.
 * The worker owns its `DistributedTunnel` + ephemeral signing + any hidden-info secret; the main
 * thread renders snapshots and serves wallet/Sui-client through the bridge.
 *
 * The boundary is Comlink: commands + the snapshot/bridge callbacks cross as RPC; their *payloads*
 * are plain / structured-cloneable (the callbacks themselves ride as `Comlink.proxy`'d references).
 * Closures (a game's `Protocol`, `MoveCodec`, `GameSessionSpec`) are imported INSIDE the worker and
 * addressed by `gameId` — they are never sent across.
