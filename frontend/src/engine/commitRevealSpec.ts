/**
 * Generic worker-engine helper for hidden-info turn games (commit-reveal: a binary move codec
 * that strips the secret from the wire, plus a per-match secret built from UI setup). It is the
 * intended de-dup of battleship's hand-rolled `MatchController` (`games/battleship/battleshipSpec.ts`),
 * encapsulating the "fire-vs-propose same-tick" ordering invariant once (design §3.1/§9).
 *
 * STATUS: typed-signature stub. The config below carries only the hidden-info fields the design
 * fixes (§3 variation table, §6): id, stake, protocol, and the REQUIRED secret-stripping codec.
 * The secret-build / fire-ordering / bot-pick / view / resume hooks are deliberately NOT modeled
 * here yet — extracting them from `BattleshipController` is the implementation step, and the doc
 * does not yet enumerate them, so inventing their shapes would get ahead of the spec.
