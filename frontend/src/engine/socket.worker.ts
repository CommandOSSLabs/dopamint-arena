/**
 * The shared SOCKET worker (ADR-0030, Phase 2). Owns the ONE relay {@link MpClient} — a single
 * WebSocket for every PvP window — while each game runs in its own game worker. `engineClient` posts
 * `{type:"config"}` once, then `{type:"attach", windowId}` transferring one end of a `MessageChannel`
 * per game worker; each port gets a {@link SocketHost} that bridges that worker's {@link RemoteMpClient}
 * to the shared socket. `{type:"detach", windowId}` on window close disposes that host + drops its port
 * — otherwise its global MpClient event subs leak and `broadcastConn` keeps posting to a dead port.
 * Socket lifecycle is broadcast to every LIVE port so each session reflects drop/resume.
 *
 * Not a Comlink worker: it speaks the raw {@link BridgePort} protocol (frames/peer are hot-path and
 * want no proxy overhead), so it uses `self.onmessage` directly to receive config + transferred ports.
