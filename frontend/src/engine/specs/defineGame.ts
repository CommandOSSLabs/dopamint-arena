/**
 * Self-registration for game specs (design §3.1). A `<game>Spec.ts` calls `defineGame(spec)`
 * at module load, so importing that module is the only step needed to register the game — no
 * central edit. `registry.ts` just imports the spec modules for their side-effects.
 *
 * NOTE: this load-time mutation IS the side-effect `registry.ts`'s bare imports depend on — it must
 * not be tree-shaken away (frontend/package.json must keep NO `"sideEffects": false`; see registry.ts).
 *
 * The map + `defineGame` + `getSpec` live HERE, not in `registry.ts`, on purpose: spec modules
 * depend on `defineGame`, and `registry.ts` depends on the spec modules. Keeping the store in a
 * leaf module (depends on nothing game-specific) breaks what would otherwise be a registry↔spec
 * import cycle — under a cycle the `const PVP_SPECS` initializer would be in its temporal dead
 * zone when a spec's top-level `defineGame(...)` runs.
