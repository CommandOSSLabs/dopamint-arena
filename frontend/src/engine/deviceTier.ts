/**
 * Device-capability tiering for the concurrent live-window cap (design §2.1). Each
 * game window runs a dedicated worker — its own V8 isolate (~a few MB of engine bundle) —
 * so the real scaling cost is memory, not CPU (workers are network-blocked at human pace).
 * `maxLiveWindows()` bounds how many worker-windows may be live at once so peak memory stays
 * within the device's budget; offscreen/torn-down windows are reclaimed and don't count.
 *
 * The tier is derived from `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` and, when present,
 * `navigator.deviceMemory` — taking the LOWER of the two implied tiers (a weak CPU must not
 * be masked by lots of RAM, or vice versa). `deviceMemory` is coarse (the API caps the
 * reported value at 8 GiB) and absent in Firefox/Safari, so when it is missing we tier off
 * cores alone (a high-core Firefox/Safari machine can still reach High/Max); only when
 * NEITHER signal is available do we default to Mid.
