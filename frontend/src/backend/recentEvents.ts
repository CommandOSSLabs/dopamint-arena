 * parties are ephemerals). On a `mine` row `address` is the viewer's OWN wallet, so they can
 * click through to their account page and confirm their involvement; otherwise it is the tunnel's
 * party. `undefined` (→ `—`) when ownership was never captured. `game` (null → "") lights up the
 * per-game tabs. The pot/amount is intentionally dropped: a live row says "this is your tunnel,"
 * not "you won X" (My-Activity keeps per-move amounts).
