// On-demand arena allocation for a single game — the "click Play → get me a bot for THIS game now"
// recipe (ADR-0025/0028), shared by every arena game's `playArena`. It is the SSoT the per-game hooks
// call so the eph-key + allocate + seat-A-deposit steps live in one place instead of copy-inlined.
//
// Unlike the connect-time batch (`enterArena` over many games, coalesced into ONE PTB by the shared
// batcher) and the add-a-game lazy path (`requestArenaGame`, which also rides the batcher), a single
// explicit Play is ONE game → ONE deposit → ONE wallet popup: no coalescing needed. So this uses a
// game-local sponsored deposit (`depositStakeStaked`) instead of the shared batcher — the same staked
// primitive `findMatch` uses, so sponsorship + top-up behave identically — and does NOT depend on the
// batcher having been configured on connect.
