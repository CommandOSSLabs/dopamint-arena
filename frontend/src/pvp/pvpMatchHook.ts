/**
 * Generic PvP-match engine shared by every symmetric, public-seed, turn-alternating tunnel game
 * (bomb-it, chicken-cross). It owns the entire control plane — matchmaking over the relay, the
 * on-chain funding handshake + stake, the per-tick propose loop with an auto-bot/human seat, the
 * out-of-React session kept alive across window remounts, warm/cold resume, cooperative settle, and
 * the 1h grace floor. A game supplies only a `PvpMatchSpec`: its protocol, view, resume adapter, and
 * how a per-seat "intent" maps to a `Move`. The previous per-game hooks were ~600-line copies of
 * this body; collapsing them here makes relay/staking/auto-mode parity hold by construction.
 *
 * Scope: public-state, no-hidden-secret games (ADR-0010) with JSON-native moves — they ride the
 * relay with the identity codec, no per-game move (de)serializer. Hidden-info games (battleship/
 * poker) are a richer superset (binary moves + secret hooks) and are NOT driven by this engine.
