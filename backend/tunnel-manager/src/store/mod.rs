//! Storage seam: the in-memory impl (today's maps/atomics; tests + local dev) and the Redis
//! impl (prod/HA) live behind these traits. Handlers hold `Arc<dyn …>` and never see Redis.
//!
//! ## Aggregation invariant
//! Each instance pushes only its own deltas into a merge-commutative primitive; no method
//! read-modify-writes a shared aggregate. Three shapes: counts → `INCRBY` (grow-only,
//! order-independent); membership → `SADD`/`SREM` (idempotent union); owned/last-writer →
//! single key + CAS (Lua), never summed. The move counter is at-most-once (undercount-safe):
//! it only ever pushes already-counted deltas, so it never inflates — do NOT add flush
//! retries, which would make it at-least-once and double-count.
