//! In-process relay transport for co-located fleet bots (ADR-0024).
//!
//! The co-located game-server runs bots as virtual bus connections instead of WebSocket clients:
//! a bot registers a `ConnId` + client channel on the relay [`crate::store::Bus`] (no socket), is
//! assigned a seat, and drives `fleet_core::play_match` over a [`BusRelayTransport`] — the
//! in-process mirror of bot-fleet's `WsRelayTransport`. This removes the bot's WS hop (the capacity
//! win at 5000 CCU: ~40k → ~5k sockets). Correctness is identical because outbound relay routing
//! reuses the SAME [`crate::mp::ws::relay_to_other`] the human WS path uses, so move-counting and
//! seat routing stay in exact parity — the relay still never signs.
//!
//! The co-located [`crate::fleet::colocated`] supervisor constructs these to play arena matches:
//! `conn_ref` is bound into the match by the [`crate::fleet::arena_rendezvous`], and `send_to_peer`
//! carries the bot's settle half for [`crate::fleet::arena_anchor`]. `await_match` mirrors the WS
//! `RelayConnection`'s queue entry for the matchmaking path (the arena flow gets its match via the
//! `BotPool` `Opened` push instead), so it stays test-exercised behind an item-level dead-code allow.
