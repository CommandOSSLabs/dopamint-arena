//! Co-located arena bots (ADR-0024 + ADR-0005 co-location): the bot's play task is spawned at
//! `arena.join`, **on the same instance as the user's WebSocket**, so every relayed frame stays
//! in-process (no cross-instance hop). It is NOT spawned at `allocate` — allocate only writes a
//! small shared reservation recipe (`{game, seat_b, tunnel_id, eph_secret}`) to the control store
//! via [`reserve_arena_slot_on`]/`put_arena_reservation`, which ANY instance can read to reconstruct
//! party B when the user actually shows up.
//!
//! **Still pure on-demand:** one short-lived task per real match, no warm pool. Because the spawn
//! trigger is the join (not the allocate), a user who allocates but never joins spawns nothing — the
//! reservation simply TTL-expires. The on-chain tunnel + seat-B funding happen in the `allocate`
//! handler (`SuiArenaOpener`), independent of the bot task; the bot resolves the pre-created tunnel
//! and co-signs with the per-match ephemeral key it re-derives from the reservation recipe.
