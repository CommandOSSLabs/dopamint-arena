//! Per-match orchestration a bot runs after `match.found`, layered on the merged
//! `tunnel_harness::PartyDriver` (PR #131). The driver now brackets the whole match —
//! `anchor.open` → co-signed move loop → `anchor.settle` — so our job shrinks to the relay-side
//! ephemeral-key exchange (learn the opponent's co-signing pubkey) and then handing the driver our
//! demuxed frame transport + the chosen [`tunnel_harness::TunnelAnchor`].
//!
//! Adding a game is still data: a [`GameProfile`] (id + stake) plus the [`Protocol`] and its
//! [`MoveStrategy`]. The anchor is the swap point: `InMemoryAnchor` drives a full off-chain match
//! (bot-vs-bot, both seats sharing one anchor instance); the Sui anchor / a relay-bridged anchor is
//! the on-chain genuine-two-party path.
