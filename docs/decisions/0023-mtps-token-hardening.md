# 0023 — MTPS token hardening (admin-only mint, coin_registry)

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-06-26
- **Builds on**: [ADR-0010](0010-mtps-stake-token.md) (the MTPS free-faucet stake token). This
  hardens that token for a public, mainnet-bound demo.

## Context

ADR-0010 shipped MTPS as a near-verbatim copy of an upstream permissionless test-coin fixture: a
shared faucet holding the `TreasuryCap` with a fully permissionless `mint(amount)`, a permissionless
`set_can_mint` kill switch, the deprecated `coin::create_currency`, and no burn. A contract review
flagged this as a griefing/brick risk in a public demo: an unbounded permissionless mint can be
driven to the u64 ceiling and brick the faucet; the kill switch is troll-accessible; the currency
standard is deprecated; and a free-form `MtpsNFT` was bundled into the coin contract.

We considered keeping a bounded public mint (a supply cap + per-call cap), but settled on a simpler,
stronger answer: **the backend faucets each player the exact amount they need.** With no public
mint at all, there is no abuse vector and no brick risk, so the cap/kill-switch machinery becomes
unnecessary.

## Decision

**Minting is AdminCap-only; the backend custodies the cap and faucets players off-chain.**
(Scope of *this* change is contract-only — the backend faucet endpoint and the frontend rewiring
are follow-ups.)

1. **No permissionless mint.** `AdminCap` wraps the `TreasuryCap`; `admin_mint(cap, amount,
   recipient)` is the only mint path, and `burn(cap, coin)` the only burn. No shared faucet, no
   supply cap, no `can_mint` kill switch — the sole authority is who holds the cap. `admin_mint`
   keeps one per-call sanity bound (`MAX_MINT_PER_CALL` = 1M MTPS, ~100× the biggest real faucet
   pull): **not** an attacker defense (admin-only already covers that) but a guardrail bounding a
   backend bug (a stray large value) minting an absurd amount. The `AdminCap` is `key`-only (no
   `store`) — it cannot be transferred after `init`, so the package **must be published by the
   backend faucet's key** (see the [deploy runbook](../runbooks/mtps-deploy.md)).
2. **`coin_registry` migration** (`new_currency_with_otw`), dropping the deprecated
   `coin::create_currency`. The OTW path is two-step: `init` only parks the `Currency`, and a
   one-time post-publish `coin_registry::finalize_registration` tx promotes it — without it,
   metadata never resolves in wallets/explorers (mint/burn still work). The `MetadataCap` is
   **kept** (handed to the deployer), not burned, so symbol/name/icon stay updatable post-deploy
   without a redeploy; the icon is set to the MTPS favicon at creation.
3. **0 decimals — whole-token stakes.** MTPS is indivisible: a 1-token tunnel deposit is the
   integer `1`, not `1e9`. This matches how games stake (whole tokens) and removes the raw-vs-whole
   conversion at every call site. Unlike metadata, **decimals are fixed at creation** (the
   `MetadataCap` cannot change them), so the choice is permanent for the deployment.
4. **NFT dropped from the coin contract.** The `MtpsNFT` is removed entirely, leaving a
   single-purpose coin package. If a collectible is needed later it ships as its own standalone
   package — it does not belong in the token contract.

## Consequences

- **Easier**: the u64 brick and mint abuse are structurally impossible (no public mint); metadata
  uses the current standard; the coin contract is single-purpose.
- **Committed / harder**: the backend must custody the `AdminCap` key and pay gas for faucet txs.
  Because the cap is `key`-only and non-transferable, the deploy key *is* the mint key — rotating
  it means a redeploy.
- **Follow-ups (NOT in this change)**: the backend HTTP faucet endpoint (mints via `admin_mint`,
  rate-limited per address); the frontend swap from the sponsored in-line `mtps::mint` PTB to that
  endpoint; dropping the sponsor's `mtps::mint`/`mint_default` allowlist; flipping the frontend MTPS
  amount constants to 0 decimals (`MTPS_DECIMALS`, `MTPS_STAKE_PER_SEAT`, `LOCKED_PER_SEAT` — a
  1-token stake becomes `1n`, not `1_000_000_000n`); and the redeploy + env id updates
  (`VITE_MTPS_*`, `TUNNEL_COIN_TYPE`), per the [deploy runbook](../runbooks/mtps-deploy.md).
  `Published.toml` is dropped here (it pinned the ADR-0010 package) and regenerates on the new
  publish. Until those land, MTPS stays on the ADR-0010 public faucet package.
- **Explicitly NOT done**: a hard supply cap (unnecessary once minting is admin-only — the per-call
  bound is only a fat-finger guardrail, not a supply ceiling).
